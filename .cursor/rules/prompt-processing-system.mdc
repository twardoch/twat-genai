# prompt-processing-system

The prompt processing system implements a specialized domain syntax for AI image generation with several key components:

## Prompt Syntax Parser (Importance: 85)
Located in `src/twat_genai/core/prompt.py`

- Midjourney-compatible syntax support with custom extensions
- Weighted segment parsing using "::" delimiter with automatic normalization
- Parameter extraction from "--" prefixed flags
- Alternative group expansion using "{option1|option2}" syntax
- Nested prompt structure preservation for multi-stage processing

## Weight Distribution System (Importance: 80)
Located in `src/twat_genai/core/prompt.py`

- Automatic weight balancing for multi-segment prompts
- Proportional distribution for implicit weights
- Weight preservation through processing stages
- Special handling for negative prompts with inverted weights

## Batch Processing Logic (Importance: 75)
Located in `src/twat_genai/core/models.py`

- Multi-prompt batching with shared parameters
- Cross-batch parameter inheritance
- Model-specific prompt validation rules
- Batch size optimization based on model constraints

## Parameter Injection (Importance: 70)
Located in `src/twat_genai/core/lora.py`

- LoRA trigger integration into prompt structure
- Dynamic parameter insertion based on model selection
- Context-aware parameter placement
- Parameter conflict resolution with precedence rules
