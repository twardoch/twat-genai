# image-transformation-algorithms

Core image transformation logic centers around three key processing pipelines:

## Outpainting System (Importance: 95)
`src/twat_genai/engines/fal/outpaint.py`

Two distinct outpainting algorithms:
1. Bria Algorithm
- Direct canvas expansion with intelligent image placement
- Contextual border generation for seamless transitions
- Dynamic border thickness based on image dimensions

2. Flux Algorithm
- Mask-based inpainting approach 
- GenFill post-processing for edge blending
- Preserves original image context during expansion

## Upscaling Pipeline (Importance: 85)
`src/twat_genai/engines/fal/upscale.py`

Model-specific transformation rules:
- ESRGAN: 2048x2048 maximum bounds
- Ideogram: 1024x1024 maximum bounds
- CCSR: 512x512 maximum bounds
- Automatic resizing based on model constraints

Specialized upscaling implementations:
- DRCT/Ideogram creative mode
- Recraft clarity enhancement
- Aura SR precision scaling
- CCSR contextual upscaling

## Size Management (Importance: 75)
`src/twat_genai/core/image.py`

Image dimension control logic:
- Model-specific input validation
- Automatic aspect ratio preservation
- Multi-stage resizing for complex transformations
- Border management for outpainting operations
