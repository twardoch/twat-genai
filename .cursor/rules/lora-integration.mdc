# lora-integration

The LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) integration system implements specialized handling of custom AI model adaptations:

## Core LoRA Processing (Importance: 95)
`src/twat_genai/core/lora.py`
- Custom specification format parsing supporting:
  - Library keyword references
  - Direct URL:scale pairs
  - Combined specifications with weight distribution
- Automatic weight normalization across multiple LoRA models
- Validation against model compatibility and constraints

## LoRA Application Logic (Importance: 90)
`src/twat_genai/engines/fal/lora.py`
- Integration with base model parameters
- Trigger-based prompt augmentation system
- Library-based resolution with hierarchical fallback:
  1. Direct URL matches
  2. Keyword lookup
  3. Combined specification parsing

## Model-Specific LoRA Handling (Importance: 85)
`src/twat_genai/core/models.py`
- Validation of LoRA compatibility with base models
- Model-specific weight scaling and limits
- Integration point validation for multi-stage pipelines

## LoRA Configuration Management (Importance: 75)
- Custom library maintenance and versioning
- Weight distribution algorithms for combined specifications
- Validation rules for model-specific constraints
