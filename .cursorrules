## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


## Core Image Generation Pipeline (Importance: 95)

The business logic centers around a sophisticated AI image generation pipeline that orchestrates:

1. Multi-stage Image Processing
- Text-to-image generation
- Image-to-image transformation
- Upscaling with model-specific constraints
- Outpainting for canvas expansion

Key Components:
- Image Generation Controller (`src/twat_genai/engines/fal/__init__.py`)
- Outpainting Engine (`src/twat_genai/engines/fal/outpaint.py`)
- Upscaling Service (`src/twat_genai/engines/fal/upscale.py`)

## Advanced Prompt Processing (Importance: 90)

Domain-specific prompt handling system implementing:

1. Midjourney-Style Syntax Processing
- Weighted prompt segments using "::" notation
- Permutation groups with "{}" syntax
- Parameter injection via "--" prefix

2. LoRA Integration
- Multi-format LoRA specification support
- Automatic weight distribution
- Library-based resolution with fallbacks

Primary Components:
- Prompt Processor (`src/twat_genai/core/prompt.py`)
- LoRA Manager (`src/twat_genai/core/lora.py`)

## Image Manipulation Logic (Importance: 85)

Specialized image transformation workflows:

1. Outpainting Algorithms
- Bria: Direct canvas expansion
- Flux: Inpainting-based approach
- Automatic border generation
- Context preservation logic

2. Model-Specific Processing
- Size constraints enforcement
- Parameter mapping for 8 distinct upscaling algorithms
- Tool-specific configuration handling

Implementation Location:
- Image Processing Core (`src/twat_genai/core/image.py`)
